A personal financial tracker with an emphasis on anticipatory cashflow

## Where does the name come from?

I decided I wanted to spend a year focusing on my finance's and putting myself
into a financially healthy state where I was no longer living paycheck to
paycheck. When I looked at tools available to help me track my spending and
plan my budgets, all of them were missing key features or had user experiences
that didn't align well with what I was looking for. I decided to build my own
project, but what to call it?

Originally, I had intended to call the project MIMO, for Money In, Money Out
(inspired by [GIGO][garbage in, garbage out] for Garbage In Garbage Out). I
found there was a type of pterosaur called a [mimodactylus][mimodactylus] that
I could use for the logo. That piece of history still exists as the logo
continues to be (planned to be) a mimodactylus.

To make a year where I was going to be spending less, eating out less, etc.
more fun for me, I decided to give it a (relatively) fun name: Zvi's Year of
Frugality, which immediately became shortened to ZYF, pronounced zif (IPA:zɪɸ).
I decided that made for a much better name than MIMO as it was less likely to
collide and was a little bit more fun to say.
